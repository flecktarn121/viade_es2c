## DESCRIPTION
Viade is a decentralized routes management system based on the solid specifications and React framework. It is a project from the Software Architecture course taught in "Universidad de Oviedo" and its purpose is to teach the students how to work in a real project and how to create a good project architecture. We also are learning how good documentation is made and how to interact with the rest os the programmers of the world using forums or chats.
